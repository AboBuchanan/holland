.. _config-global:

Global Config
-------------

The main configuration file (usually /etc/holland/holland.conf) defines
both global settings as well as the active backup sets. It is divided into
two sections :ref:`[holland]<holland-config>` and :ref:`[logging]<logging-config>`. 

.. _holland-config:

[holland]
^^^^^^^^^

.. _holland-config-plugin_dirs:

.. describe:: plugin_dirs = [directory1],[directory2],...,[directoryN]

    Defines where the plugins can be found. This can be a comma-separated 
    list but usually does not need to be modified. For most installations,
    this will usually be ``/usr/share/holland/plugins``.

.. deprecated:: 1.0.8

    This option is no longer required and can be ommitted. 
    
.. _holland-config-backup_directory:    
    
.. describe:: backup_directory = [directory]

    Top-level directory where backups are held. This is usually 
    ``/var/spool/holland``.
    
.. _holland-config-backupsets:

.. describe:: backupsets = [backupset1],[backupset2],...,[backupsetN]

    A comma-separated list of all the backup sets Holland should backup.
    Each backup set is defined in ``/etc/holland/backupsets/<name>.conf`` by
    default.
    
.. describe:: umask = [0000-7777]

    Sets the umask of the resulting backup files.
    
.. describe:: path = <directory1>:<directory2>:...:<directoryN>

    Defines a path for holland and its spawned processes.

.. _logging-config:
    
[logging]
^^^^^^^^^

.. describe:: filename = [path]/[filename]

    The log file itself.

.. describe:: level = [debug|info|warning|error|critical]

    Sets the verbosity of Holland's logging process. Available options are
    ``debug``, ``info``, ``warning``, ``error``, and ``critical``

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: ini

    ## Root holland config file
    [holland]

    ## Paths where holland plugins may be found.
    ## Can be comma separated
    plugin_dirs = /usr/share/holland/plugins

    ## Top level directory where backups are held
    backup_directory = /var/spool/holland

    ## List of enabled backup sets. Can be comma separated. 
    ## Read from <config_dir>/backupsets/<name>.conf
    # backupsets = example, traditional, parallel_backups, non_transactional
    backupsets = mydbbackup, pgdump-full, mysql-lvm-reportingdb

    # Define a umask for file generated by holland
    umask = 0007

    # Define a path for holland and its spawned processes
    path = /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin

    [logging]
    ## where to write the log
    filename = /var/log/holland.log

    ## debug, info, warning, error, critical (case insensitive)
    level = info
