.SH BUGS
.INDENT 0.0

.IP \(bu 2
mk\-config is new and has various formatting issues


.IP \(bu 2
purge is run at the end of every backup.  If a backup is interrupted,
purge will be delayed until the end of the next successful backup run.


.IP \(bu 2
disk\-space estimations are still quite rough and may overestimate in many cases.
As a workaround, most plugins provide a scale factor setting to adjust estimates
accordingly.
