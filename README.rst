Welcome to Holland!
===================

Holland is an Open Source backup framework originally developed at Rackspace
and written in Python. Its goal is to help facilitate backing up databases 
with greater configurability, consistency, and ease. Holland currently focuses 
on MySQL, however future development will include other database platforms 
and even non-database related applications. Because of its plugin structure,
Holland can be used to backup anything you want by whatever means you want.

This is the Holland-1.1 branch which is a development release.
