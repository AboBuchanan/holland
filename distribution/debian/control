 Holland Mythos
 .
 The group came up with the name Holland in allusion to the fictional story of 
 Hans Brinker, a dutch boy who saved Holland by sticking his thumb in a leaking 
 dike hole overnight.

 The Holland Skunk Works Dev Team represent the little boy, stopping the
 inevitable flood.

 The ocean represents our customers, and the rising tide of MySQL backup needs 
 at Rackspace.

 The dike represents Rackspace.
