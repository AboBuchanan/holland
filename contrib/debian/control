 Holland Mythos
 .
 The group came up with the name Holland in allusion to the fictional story of 
 Hans Brinker, a dutch boy who saved Holland by sticking his thumb in a leaking 
 dike hole overnight.
 .
 The Holland Skunk Works Dev Team represent the little boy, stopping the
 inevitable flood.
 .
 The ocean represents our customers, and the rising tide of MySQL backup needs 
 at Rackspace.
 .
 The dike represents Rackspace.
