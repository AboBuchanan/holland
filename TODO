holland.core.config
-------------------
* Leading whitespace is always improperly evaluated as continuation lines
* Inline comments are not supported (and certainly used in some holland-1.0
  configs).  This must be fixed [XXX: Fixed]
* validation needs to raise errors consistently and reports on missing
  values at the end
* validation should support 'required' 'aliasof' and 'deprecated' attributes
  'required' -> this value is required for normal operation.  automatically 
  a validation error when missing
  'aliasof' -> alias of some other setting.   anytime we run into this we 
               rewrite the config attribute to "real" key
  'deprecated' -> flag this setting as deprecated so a warning is raised
  		  perhaps allow a configurable message to note why the 
		  deprecation has occurred and when the setting will be removed
  'help' -> simple help message describing the setting

* Test more invalid configs to see how we handle that.

holland.core.hooks
------------------
* Hooks priorities may be useful as well - that is perhaps we should load all
  hooks for an event and sort them by priority before adding them to the 
  dispatcher Signal.  Alternatively we can extend Signal() to support a
  priority when connecting.  Presorting is somewhat faster but I don't think
  performance will be a major concern here.

* Disable hooks entirely by use of an option.  This should probably be set
  via the command line as well as via a configuration option
  [XXX: Fixed - added --skip-hooks.  and hooks can be commented out]


holland.cli
-----------
* Implement purge command again.  This should simply call
  BackupManager.purge(backup_id) where backup_id is either
  a name of a "backupset/backup" or a backupset.  Must
  adhere to holland 1.0's interface for compatibility.
