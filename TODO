holland.core.config
-------------------
* Leading whitespace is always improperly evaluated as continuation lines
* Inline comments are not supported (and certainly used in some holland-1.0
  configs).  This must be fixed
* validation needs to raise errors consistently and reports on missing
  values at the end

holland.core.hooks
------------------
* Hooks must be able to be run multiple times.  Right now the single command
  hook assumes a single section [holland:hooks:cmd] but we should rather use
  a user-specified section:

  [holland:backup]
  ...
  # events
  after-backup = push-to-staging, also-push-to-devbox
  ...
  [push-to-staging]
  plugin = command
  cmd = rsync -avz ${backupdir} /path/to/staging/

  [push-to-devbox]
  plugin = command
  cmd = rsync -avz ${backupdir} /path/to/dev/
  #EOF

* We should probably assume `command` as the default plugin for simplicity, 
  although more full-featured python plugins might be created in the future.

* Hooks priorities may be useful as well - that is perhaps we should load all
  hooks for an event and sort them by priority before adding them to the 
  dispatcher Signal.  Alternatively we can extend Signal() to support a
  priority when connecting.  Presorting is somewhat faster but I don't think
  performance will be a major concern here.
