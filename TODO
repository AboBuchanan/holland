holland.core.config
-------------------
* Leading whitespace is always improperly evaluated as continuation lines
* Inline comments are not supported (and certainly used in some holland-1.0
  configs).  This must be fixed
* validation needs to raise errors consistently and reports on missing
  values at the end

holland.core.hooks
------------------
* Hooks must be able to be run multiple times.  Right now the single command
  hook assumes a single section [holland:hooks:cmd] but we should rather use
  a user-specified section:

  [holland:backup]
  ...
  # events
  after-backup = push-to-staging, also-push-to-devbox
  ...
  [push-to-staging]
  plugin = command
  cmd = rsync -avz ${backupdir} /path/to/staging/

  [push-to-devbox]
  plugin = command
  cmd = rsync -avz ${backupdir} /path/to/dev/
  #EOF

  We should probably assume `command` as the default
  plugin for simplicity, although more full-featured
  python plugins might be created in the future.
