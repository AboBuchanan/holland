    * holland backup --dry-run now checks available disk

      Resolves [#1443]

2009-07-28  Andrew Garner <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Improved commvault option parsing.

2009-07-24  Andrew Garner <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>

2009-07-13  BJ Dierkes <wdierkes@rackspace.com> 
    * Holland 0.9.3 released.
 

2009-07-08  Andrew Garner <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Fixed a couple bugs in holland.commands.mysql where
      mysql-extract would fail. Resolves [#1379]
    * Made estimated backup size adjustments more 
      consistent.  [holland:backup] now accepts
      a 'estimated-size-factor' that is a decimal
      multiplier (default 1.0).  This will apply
      to any provider without any special support.
      This also removes free-space-factor from the
      mysqldump and mysqlhotcopy plugins and their
      example configs.  Resolves [#1378]
    * Added 'backups-to-keep=1' to holland mk-config 
      generated configs. Resolves [#1374]
    * Strip unknown opts when generating a my.cnf with
      make_mycnf in holland.lib.mysql. Resolves [#1377]

    * Fix dry-run when using file-per-database option
      Resolves [#1373]

2009-06-11  BJ Dierkes <wdierkes@rackspace.com> 
    * Cleaned up --help output a bit.  Resolves [#1333]
    * Holland 0.9.2 released.

2009-06-03  BJ Dierkes <wdierkes@rackspace.com>
    * Holland 0.9.1 released.

2009-05-06  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Added holland.lib.mysql.client.connect method. This
      rewrites my.cnf parameters to what MySQLdb.connect
      expects.  This allows passing option files from
      holland.lib.mysql.option to the client.connect method
      and connecting without necessarily flushing the options
      to disk and using read_default_file=<path>.

2009-04-19  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Holland 0.3 released.

2009-04-19  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Converted holland.lib.mysql.client testcases to use
      mock objects instead of direct dbapi connections
    * Added Ian Bicking's multidict implementation to 
      holland.lib.common (used by holland.lib.mysql.option
      but probably generally useful)
    * mk-config now adds a [holland:backup] section to 
      generated configs

2009-04-17  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * The mysqldump plugin now logs SHOW SLAVE STATUS
      replication information to [mysql:replication] in
      the backup.conf rather than to a separate replication.conf
      file.
    * Added "holland purge" command
    * The holland.lib.mysql plugin distribution no longer lists
      a setuptools dependency on MySQL-Python.  This was breaking
      on OS X in some cases and overall slowing down test runs.
    * Fixed a compatibility problem in validate.py that was preventing
      holland from running on python-2.3 (RHEL4)
    * Further improvements to [.]my.cnf option-file processing in
      holland.lib.mysql
    * mysqlhotcopy and maatkit plugins now use the new my.cnf interface
      in holland.lib.mysql.option
    * /etc/holland/holland.conf is the default config file location
      if an explicit --config is not specified or HOLLAND_CONFIG is
      not set.
    * [COMPATIBILITY] backupsets are now required to specify a 
      [holland:backup] section with a 'plugin' parameter to specify
      the plugin to use (mysqldump,mysqlhotcopy,maatkit,...) rather
      than a "root-level" provider option. This allows holland's config
      files to be processed by non-ConfigObj standard ini-tools.
      Further, [holland:backup] provides a bucket to record other
      backup information about the backupset in the saved backup.conf
      in the spool directory.
    * Fixed a problem in "holland mk-config" that didn't generate optional
      default=None parameters correctly.
    * Fixed a minor rendering bug in Commmand.py's help formatting.
    * Fixed a bug in holland help when referencing a command that does not
      exist.
    * Lots of bugfixes
    * Coalesced holland.lib.archive and holland.lib.compression into
      holland.lib.common distribution, along with a few other modules
      that were previously in holland-core (but unused by holland-core)

2009-04-16  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Upgraded to ConfigObj 4.6.0, validate.py 1.0.0
    * Cleaned up holland-core structure
    * Added several in-progress plugins
    * Moved many of the development "helper" scripts in trunk/
      to trunk/dev-util/

2009-04-01  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Fixed maatkit plugin logging to capture stderr output
      when running mk-parallel-dump

2009-03-27  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Added "holland mk-config" command to generate a backupset
      config file.
    * The mysqldump plugin now saves replication information from
      SHOW SLAVE STATUS to replication.conf when backing up a slave
      if bin-log-position is also defined.

2009-03-24  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Updated [.]my.cnf option-file processing in holland.lib.mysql
    * Improved the performance of mysqlhotcopy backup (Issue #1191)
    * Made stopping/starting slaves with mysqldump plugin more robust
    * Added "defaults-extra-file" parameter to mysqldump plugin
      This takes a list of my.cnf files which are used with the 
      backupset's mysqlclient config to produce a my.cnf auth-file.
    
2009-03-11  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    * Added "holland list-backups" command to show available backups
    * Fixed backup purging functionality (Issue #1190)
     
2009-03-10  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>
    
    * Holland 0.2 release
    * Bugfixes for Holland-Core
    * Renamed holland.providers to holland.backup
    * Refactored MySQLDump Backup Plugin; Now supports 
      advanced database and table filtering and many
      new features previously broken in the config file
      are now enabled
    * Better logging throughout framework and plugins
    * Enable dry-run support; Supported in all backup plugins
    * Added MySQLHotcopy backup plugin
    * Added Archive library plugin (used by MySQLHotcopy)
    * Added Maatkit backup plugin (uses mk-parallel-dump)

2009-02-20  Andrew Garner  <andrew.garner@rackspace.com>

    * Holland 0.1 released
