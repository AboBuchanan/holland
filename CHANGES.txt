1.0.6 - ?
---------
holland
+++++++
- holland backup better differentiates between a dry-run and normal backup
  in logging output
- holland mk-config now produces cleaner output and includes a --minimal
  option to strip comments from the backupset output.
- holland now more elegantly handles running the same backupset more than
  once per second.  Previously this could result in a stack trace as the
  backupset directory already exists.
- holland now maintains newest and oldest symlinks in each backupset
  directory pointing to the newest and oldest backup.
  (Contribution from Micah Yoder)
- holland.conf now accepts a tmpdir option for environments where
  manipulating TEMPDIR environment variable is not convenient
- holland backup --help is now consistent with holland help backup
  (Fixes LP#677716)
- holland now warns about unknown options in config files
- The example plugin has been deprecated in favor of the holland-random
  plugin, which provides a more useful starting example
- previously when logging failed (disk space, permissions, etc.) a stack
  trace would be printed on stderr.  As of 1.0.6 this is only done in when
  the logging level is set to 'debug'
- holland backup --dry-run previously failed for mysqldump backups when 
  per-table exclusions were specified. (Fixes GH#60)
- config files are now read as utf8 (Fixes GH#57)


holland-mysqldump
+++++++++++++++++
- holland-mysqldump now only stops the SQL_THREAD when stop-slave is 
  requested
- error messages from MySQLdb are now decoded from utf8 as necessary
- holland-mysqldump now defaults max-allowed-packet to 128M
- holland-mysqldump now excludes performance_schema by default
- holland-mysqldump now more reliably parses my.cnf files specified via
  defaults-extra-files


holland-mysqllvm
++++++++++++++++
- when a volume group has zero free extents, an unhandled exception would be
  thrown due to a bug in formatting the error message (Fixed LP#699795)
- holland-mysqllvm had a bug in the example config file that would always
  maintain two backups
- holland-mysqllvm now catches SIGHUP/SIGTERM more consistently
- holland-mysqllvm logs error output from various commands more consistently
- holland-mysqllvm will not create snapshot-mountpoint if it does
  not exist (Fixes LP#671965)
- holland-mysqllvm previously failed to automatically mount xfs snapshots
  with nouuid.  This is now automatically detected (Fixes GH#61)
- additional tests for ext3 and xfs filesystems were added to holland.lib.lvm


holland-xtrabackup
++++++++++++++++++
- holland-xtrabackup now logs stderr output on a backup failure. Previously
  this was only logged to xtrabackup.log in the backup directory.
  (Fixes LP#671971)
- holland-xtrabackup should now be built by default in contrib/holland.spec


holland-sqlite
++++++++++++++
- add missing inline compression option.


holland-pgdump
++++++++++++++
- Added holland-pgdump plugin (Contribution from Micah Yoder)
