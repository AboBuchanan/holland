-----------
holland.core
++++++++++++
- Refactored holland command line functionality from holland.core 
  into a separate holland.cli module
- holland.core.backports have been moved into holland.cli. Any compatibility
  or portability concerns regarding 3rd party modules are now considered a
  frontend responsibility
- holland.core.commands have been reimplemented and moved into the holland.cli
  package
- holland.core.config has been reimplemented and moved into the holland.cli
  package
- Forked django.dispatch into holland.core.dispatch to provide a robust
  and general callback mechanism.  Hooks will be implemented on top of
  this support.

holland.core.plugin
+++++++++++++++++++
- New implementation of holland.core.plugin
- holland.core.plugin.BasePlugin exposes a standard interface for
  all holland plugins. holland.core framework interfaces that support 
  plugins will now expose some subclass of holland.core.plugin.BasePlugin
- BasePlugin.plugin_info now supports an api versioning mechanism.  Plugins
  should now return provide an api_version attribute in their plugin_info()
  that matches the version of holland they were designed against. See the
  documentation for further details.
- holland.core.plugin.PluginManager exposes a standard for loading
  plugins.  The default implementation now abstracts away pkg_resources'
  entrypoints via EntrypointPluginManager
  Entrypoints have been abstracted behind a new interface in
  holland.core.plugin.PluginManager
